TensorFlow is an open-source powerhouse in machine learning frameworks developed by the Google Brain team. Its collaborative and open nature fosters innovation and continuous improvement within the global developer community. Renowned for its scalability, TensorFlow seamlessly deploys models across various platforms, from edge devices to cloud servers, catering to various applications. Its versatility shines through its support for diverse machine-learning tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, TensorFlow Extended (TFX) offers an end-to-end platform for deploying production-ready models, while TensorFlow Lite facilitates model deployment on mobile and edge devices. TensorFlow Hub provides a repository of pre-trained models and reusable components.

On the other hand, Keras emerges as an open-source, high-level neural networks API written in Python, boasting a user-friendly and modular design. Its simplicity and abstraction make it an ideal choice for beginners, allowing for rapid prototyping of neural network models. Keras is backend-agnostic, enabling seamless switching between backends, with TensorFlow being the default. Its extensibility allows for custom layers, loss functions, and metrics to cater to specific research or development needs. Since its integration into TensorFlow 2.0, Keras has become the official high-level API for building and training machine learning models, combining simplicity with the power of TensorFlow. Supported by a vibrant community, Keras offers extensive documentation, tutorials, and pre-trained models, making it a popular choice for deep learning enthusiasts. Together, TensorFlow and Keras form a robust ecosystem that addresses the diverse requirements of the machine learning and deep learning community, solidifying their position as leading platforms in the field.
